# Getting Started with SOMA


There are many ways to get started with SOMA.


### 1. Start a Free Account at SOMA.com


SOMA.com is managed by the organization (Frappe) that publishes SOMA.
You can start with your own account by [signing up on the
website](https://erpnext.com).


You can also decide to host your application at erpnext.com by buying the
hosting plans. This way you support the organization that develops and
improves SOMA. You also get one-to-one functional (usage) support with the
hosting plans.


### 2. Install SOMA on your Unix/Linux/Mac machine


If you are familiar with installing applications on \*nix platforms, read the instructions on how to install using [Frappe Bench](https://github.com/frappe/bench).
