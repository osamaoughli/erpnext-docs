# Document States


**Document State is the colored badge you see in the Status column in the list view and beside the title in the form view.**


This feature allows you to define or customize the colors of the statuses of your documents.


## Customize status color


Let's say you want to change the color of "Overdue" status in the Task doctype:


1. Go to Customize Form and select Task to customize
2. Scroll down to the Document States section and change the color of "Overdue"
